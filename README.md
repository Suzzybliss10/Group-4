Project Description
This project focuses on analyzing text data related to child safeguarding and domestic abuse issues using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. It utilizes Python's SpaCy library for tasks such as text summarization, named entity recognition (NER), and word frequency analysis. The analysis aims to extract key insights, identify common themes, and visualize important aspects of the text data.

Key Features

Text summarization to condense lengthy documents into key points.
Named entity recognition (NER) to identify and categorize entities such as organizations, dates, and legal acts.
Word frequency analysis to identify common themes and topics.
Visualization of word frequencies using word clouds, histograms, and heatmaps for better interpretation.
